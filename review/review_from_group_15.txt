Review from group 15:
Things you are doing well:
- You identified from the VTune report that there may be issues with thread load balancing and cache utilization.
- You have completed an MPI implementation.
- You remembered to use _mm_ intrinsics.
Things you can improve on:
- You may need to improve your MPI implementation such that it is able to handle non-square number of processors.
- You could try other ways of tuning the code like the methods in matmul, in addition to blocking.
